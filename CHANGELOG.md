# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.2.2] - Current Version

### Added
- New utility `sanitizeDomain(domain, options)` to normalize and validate domains
- New utility `safeParseDate(input)` that returns `Date` for valid inputs or `undefined` for invalid/empty values
- Unit tests for domain sanitization and safe date parsing

### Changed
- Product mapping now uses `safeParseDate` for `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, and `publishedAt` to prevent `Invalid Date`
- `publishedAt` mapping in single-product DTO now defaults to `null` when input is invalid
- Store info parsing: normalize protocol-relative (`//...`) and relative (`/...`) social/contact URLs to `https://`

### Fixed
- Preserved `www.` when `stripWWW: false` in `sanitizeDomain`
- TypeScript issues in tests: removed non-existent variant fields and aligned `compare_at_price` types
- Strengthened URL handling to avoid malformed links in `StoreInfo`

## [2.1.1] - Current Version

- Updated JSDoc comments for consistency with new API structure

// Before (pre-rename)
const products = await store.products.all();
const product = await store.products.find("handle");

// After (post-rename) - Same methods, enhanced functionality

const product = await client.products.find("handle");
```

#### **New Store Information**
```typescript
// Post-rename (v3.8.2+) - New feature

- No new external dependencies added
- Improved internal dependency management

---

## [1.0.2] - Previous Stable Release

### Features
- Basic product fetching with `Store` class
- Product pagination and search by handle
- Basic product data normalization
- Simple TypeScript type definitions

### API Structure (pre-rename: shop-search)

    find(handle: string): Promise<Product>
  }
}
```

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes Summary
1. **Class renamed**: `Store` → `ShopClient`
2. **Enhanced type system**: Many new types added, some existing types enhanced
3. **New modular architecture**: Operations split into dedicated modules
4. **Enhanced return types**: More comprehensive data structures

### Backward Compatibility
- Core product fetching methods maintain the same signatures
- Existing product data structure remains compatible
- TypeScript users may need to update import statements

### Recommended Upgrade Path
1. Update import statements to use `ShopClient`
2. Test existing product operations (should work without changes)
3. Gradually adopt new features like store info and collections
4. Update TypeScript types if using custom type definitions
